    This API makes sure the card is active, before cancelling or closing the

    card. It also helps to check the card balance by showing the
    transactions.             

    This endpoint validates two functionalities – The status of the card and the
    transactions of the card.


    Once the user is authenticated, this endpoint generates an authorization
    token by using the API key and the Client key.  This authorization token is
    valid for 30 minutes.
